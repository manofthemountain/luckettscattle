      <li><strong>Reserve your share.</strong> You pick quarter, half, or whole. We estimate timing and total cost range and collect a deposit once we lock in a processor date.</li>
      <li><strong>We manage the animal.</strong> The animal stays in our rotation on small pastures around Lucketts. You’re welcome to ask how it’s doing any time.</li>
      <li><strong>We schedule harvest.</strong> When the date is close, we confirm details and walk through a sample cut sheet if you’re new to buying bulk beef.</li>
      <li><strong>You choose your cuts.</strong> You’ll decide bone-in vs boneless, roast vs ground, steak thickness, packaging preferences, and more with the processor.</li>
      <li><strong>Pickup day.</strong> Once aging and cutting are complete, you pick up your boxed, labeled beef from the processor or via a local pickup option we arrange.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask questions anytime.</strong> If anything in your boxes is unfamiliar, we’re happy to talk recipes, cooking tips, and how to use every cut.</li>
