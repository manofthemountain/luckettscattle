    <p style="font-size:0.95rem;line-height:1.7;">
      Lucketts Cattle Co. started with a simple idea: could a small, well-managed herd spread across
      multiple small pastures still produce truly great beef for local families?
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:0.95rem;line-height:1.7;">
      We’re not trying to be the biggest operation in Virginia. We’re aiming for something different:
      a human-scale herd, genetics selected for our climate, and beef that makes you rethink what
      “local” can taste like.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:0.95rem;line-height:1.7;">
      As we grow, we’ll share more of the behind-the-scenes details — grazing plans, weights, carcass
      data, and what we learn along the way.
